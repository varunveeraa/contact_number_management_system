## contact_number_management_system

###Aim:
 To build a phone management system.

###Objective of the Project:
To implement various operations associated with a contact book using data structures and file
handling operations such as:
1. Inserting a contact
2. Displaying all contacts
3. Searching for a contact
4. Deleting a contact
5. Modifying a contact
6. Saving all the contacts to a file
7. Exit

###Introduction:
 A contact book contains the data a person needs when contacting his/her friends. The
data may consist of various attributes such as first name, last name, number etc. What
is crucial is that the data should be stored using appropriate data structures to perform
relevant operations on it. Since operations such as insertion, deletion and modification
need to be frequently performed on the contacts, a dynamically linked list is an apt
choice to implement the contact book. This allows an effective utilization of memory
and also makes insertion and deletion easier. Further, the contacts stored in the linked
list need to be saved to a data file from time to time, so that a copy of the contact book
exists even when the program terminates. For faster execution, we choose the format
of the file to be binary (.dat), since no character translations need to be done when
storing to and reading from a binary file.
Language used: C++

###Scope:
 In future one change can be done by adding fingerprints of the persons of which the
 address is entered and one more major change which can be done in this project is that
 the snap of the person can be added.
 
###Data structure used:
 Since operations such as insertion, deletion and modification need to be frequently
performed on the contacts, a dynamically linked list is an apt choice to implement the
contact book. This allows an effective utilization of memory and also makes insertion
and deletion easier. Further, the contacts stored in the linked list need to be saved to a
data file from time to time, so that a copy of the contact book exists even when the
program terminates. For faster execution, we choose the format of the file to be binary
(.dat), since no character translations need to be done when storing to and reading
from a binary file.

###Framework:
 When the program is run, it asks the user to enter the choice .The insert button gets
 input from the user and saves it temporarily. When the display option is chosen, the
 details are displayed to the user. The edit option is used to edit the details of the user
 based on the first name, date of birth and phone number. The delete option gets the
 name of the user and deletes the particular node. The save option save the details in an
 external DAT file.

###Conclusion:
Thus, the project to create a contact book and execute various operations on it has been
successfully made. It can be used in electronic gadgets to save contacts in phone.
